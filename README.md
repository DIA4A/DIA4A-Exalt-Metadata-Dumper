# This tool is outdated and will not work

# DIA4A-Exalt-Metadata-Dumper
A tool to dump the decrypted global metadata header, unshuffle the header and ultimately create a global-metadata.dat file for tools

Either compile both projects using Release x64 or download a copy of the compiled files from Release

Once you have the 2 required files (`DumperModule.dll`, `Exalt Metadata Dumper.exe`) move them into the `Production` folder of `RealmOfTheMadGod` (`RealmOfTheMadGod\Production`) and run `Exalt Metadata Dumper.exe`.
If all goes well, a new folder `DIA4A` will be created in the very same folder where all the files will be placed.
